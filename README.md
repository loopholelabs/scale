[Scale](https://scale.sh) is a highly-performant WebAssembly function runtime that enables composable, language-agnostic software development.

With Scale Functions you can write code in any language, then use it from any other language, environment, or runtime, with state-of-the-art sandboxing qualities, startup times, and overall performance. This initial release includes client support for [Golang](https://golang.org) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), with runtimes for [Golang](https://golang.org) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Usage and Documentation

Usage instructions and documentation for the Scale Runtime is available at [https://scale.sh/docs](https://scale.sh/docs).
