[Scale](https://scale.sh) is a highly-performant WebAssembly function runtime that enables composable, language-agnostic software development.

With Scale Functions you can write code in any language, then use it from any other language, environment, or runtime, with state-of-the-art sandboxing qualities, startup times, and overall performance. This initial release includes client support for Go and Rust, with runtimes for Go and TypeScript.

## Important note about releases and stability

This repository generally follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). However, **this library is currently in
Beta** and is still considered experimental. Breaking changes of the library will _not_ trigger a new major release. The
same is true for selected other new features explicitly marked as
**EXPERIMENTAL** in [the changelog](/CHANGELOG.md).

## Usage and Documentation

Usage instructions and documentation for the Scale Runtime is available at [https://scale.sh/docs](https://scale.sh/docs).
