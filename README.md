With [Scale Functions](https://scale.sh) your users can write fully typed plugins in any language they choose, and your application can easily and safely 
run those plugins with the Scale Runtime, which provides state-of-the-art sandboxing, low startup times, and extremely high performance.

Currently, guest plugins can be written in [Golang](https://golang.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with the Runtime supporting [Golang](https://golang.org) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) host applications.
