title: Quick Start
description: Create, run, and publish your first Scale Function in just 5 minutes
---

In this section we’ll be going over how you can quickly get started with Scale to create, run and even publish your own function.

We’ll be building a simple `Hello World` function using the [HTTP Signature](/signatures/http) that will return a simple greeting.

<Tip>
    Note that Scale currently supports using both [Golang](https://go.dev) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as the Guest
    Language, and the documentation will always have example implementations in both languages.
</Tip>

## Install the Scale CLI

The Scale CLI is the primary tool for interacting with Scale Functions and the Scale Registry. It can be easily installed using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dl.scale.sh | sh
```

<Info>
    The CLI attempts to install itself to `/usr/local/bin` by default, but you can also specify a different directory by setting the `INSTALL` environment variable like so:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://dl.scale.sh | INSTALL=./ sh
    ```
</Info>

To verify that the CLI was installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
scale version
```

For alternative installation methods or to build the CLI from source, please see the [CLI Installation Guide](/cli/install).

## Install the Toolchain for your Guest Language

Scale Functions currently support using both [Golang](https://go.dev) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as the
Guest Languages, but compiling them requires the appropriate toolchain to be installed on your machine.

<Note>
    To streamline compiling Scale Functions in the future, we're working on a cloud build service that will allow you to
    compile your functions without having to install the toolchain on your machine. If you're interested in accessing this
    service as soon as it's available, please join the `#scale` on our [discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).
</Note>

If you already have the toolchain for your Guest Language installed, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can follow
the guides for your Guest Language below to install the toolchain.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Golang">
        To use [Golang](https://go.dev) as the Guest Language, you'll need to install the following:
        - The [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) toolchain
        - The [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/) compiler

        The best way to install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) is to follow the official instructions for your
        operating system and platform at [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

        You can verify that Go was installed correctly by running the following command:

        ```bash
        go version
        ```

        <Info>
            The minimum supported version of Go for use with Scale Functions is `1.18`.
        </Info>


        The best way to install [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/) is to follow the official
        instructions for your operating system and platform at
        [https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install).

        You can verify that TinyGo was installed correctly by running the following command:

        ```bash
        tinygo version
        ```

        <Info>
            The minimum supported version of TinyGo for use with Scale Functions is `0.27.0`.
        </Info>
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Rust">
        To use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as the Guest Language, you'll need to install the following:
        - The [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) toolchain
        - The [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) package manager
        - The [wasm32-unknown-unknown](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#platform-specific-dependencies) build target

        The best way to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is to follow the official instructions for
        your operating system and platform at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

        In general, you'll want to install the `rustup` tool, which will allow you to easily install and manage multiple
        versions of Rust on your machine. This can be done by running the following command:

        ```bash
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
        ```

        You can verify that Rust was installed correctly by running the following command:

        ```bash
        rustc --version
        ```

        <Info>
            The minimum supported version of Rust for use with Scale Functions is `1.67.0`.
        </Info>

        You can verify that Cargo was installed correctly by running the following command:

        ```bash
        cargo --version
        ```

        <Info>
            The minimum supported version of Cargo for use with Scale Functions is `1.67.0`.
        </Info>

        Next, you'll need to install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build target. This can be done by running the following
        command:

        ```bash
        rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
        ```

        You can verify that the build target was installed correctly by running the following command and verifying that
        `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is listed in the output:

        ```bash
        rustup target list --installed
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Create a New Function

Once you have the Scale CLI and the toolchain for your Guest Language installed, you can create a new function by
running the following command:

```bash
scale new hello-world
```

This will create a new scale function in the current directory. You can also specify a different directory by passing the
`--directory` or `-d` flag:

```bash
scale new hello-world -d /path/to/directory
```

<Note>
    By default, the CLI will create a new function using Golang as the Guest Language. If you want to use Rust instead,
    you can pass the `--language` or `-l` flag:

    ```bash
    scale new hello-world -l rust
    ```
</Note>

The following files will be created in the directory depending on the language you chose:

    <Tab title="Golang">
        <CodeGroup>
            ```yaml scalefile
            version: v1alpha

            version: v0.3.4
            source: scale.go
            ```

                signature "github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature-http"
            )

            func Scale(ctx *signature.Context) (*signature.Context, error) {
                ctx.Response().SetBody("Hello, World!")
                return ctx.Next()
            }
            ```

            ```go-module go.mod
            module scale

            go 1.18

        </CodeGroup>
        The `scalefile` is the main configuration file for the function. It contains all of the metadata and configuration required
        to build and run the function. The `scale.go` file contains the actual implementation of the function, and
        the `go.mod` file is primarily used to provide [Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)
        and Auto-Completion support in your IDE.

        The `scalefile` is the main configuration file for the function. It contains all of the metadata and configuration required
        to build and run the function. The `scale.rs` file contains the actual implementation of the function, and

    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<br/>
<Info>
    When adding new dependencies to your function, you'll need to add references to them in the `scalefile` to make sure
    your function can be built properly.
</Info>

By default, the generated function will be configured to use the `HTTP Signature`,
which provides an interface for handling HTTP requests and responses. To learn more about the `HTTP Signature` and the
interfaces it provides, you can check out the [HTTP Signature Reference](/signatures/http).

<Note>
    The concept of a `Signature` is central to how Scale Functions provide cross-language type safety and it's documented
    in more detail in the [Signatures](/signatures/overview) section of the documentation.
</Note>

## Build the Function

Once you've created a new function, you can build it by running the following command:

```bash
scale build
```

This will build the function and save it to the `Cache Directory` (which defaults to `~/.config/scale/functions` on Linux and macOS).
You can also specify a different directory by passing the `--cache-directory` flag:

```bash
scale build --cache-directory /path/to/directory
```

<Info>
    The `Cache Directory` is where the Scale CLI stores all of the built functions. This is where the CLI will look for
    functions when you run commands like `scale run` or `scale push`.
</Info>

To list all of the functions that are currently in the `Cache Directory`, you can run the following command:

```bash
scale function list
```

```
  NAME (1)            TAG      ORG           LANGUAGE   SIGNATURE     HASH                                                               VERSION
 ------------------- -------- ------------- ---------- ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------
  hello-world         latest                 rust       http@v0.3.4   8dad03b701cd124b55ff5caf7a36a9af5d19759fc73a9e8299bea4816f929777   v1alpha
```

## Run the Function

Once you've built the function, you can run it by running the following command:

```bash
scale run hello-world:latest
```

This will start a local HTTP server on port `8080` and will run the function whenever you make a request to it. You can
also specify a different port by passing the `--port` or `-p` flag:

```bash
scale run hello-world:latest -p 3000
```

<Note>
    The `scale run` command is designed for use with the [HTTP Signature](/signatures/http). It can be used for both
    local development and production deployments and makes it easy to test your function without having to deploy it.
</Note>

## Push the Function

Now that you've built and tested your function, you can push it to the Scale Registry. Once pushed, the function can be
pulled and used in your existing Typescript or Golang services, or even by other users for their own applications.

To use the Scale Registry, you'll first have to authenticate with the Scale API. This process is the same for both new
and existing users.

To authenticate with the Scale API, you can run the following command:

```bash
scale auth login
```

This will open a browser window and prompt you to log in to your Scale account. Once you've logged in, you can
close the browser window and return to the terminal. You should now be able to push your function to the Scale Registry.

To check that you're authenticated, you can run the following command:

```bash
scale auth status
```

```

  []            [shivanshvij]   shivanshvij@loopholelabs.io   shivanshvij
```

<Note>
    It's also possible to authenticate with the Scale API using an API Key. To learn more about API Keys, you can check
    out the [API Keys](/api-keys) section of the documentation.
</Note>

Once you've authenticated with the Scale API, you can push your function to the Scale Registry by running the following command:

```bash
scale push hello-world:latest
```

This will push the function to the Scale Registry and make it available for use in your existing services. By default
the function will be private, but you can make it public by passing the `--public` flag:

```bash
scale push hello-world:latest --public
```

<Note>
    The Scale Registry is currently in beta and may be subject to changes in the future. To learn more about the
    Scale Registry, you can check out the [Registry](/registry/overview) section of the documentation or [join our Discord](https://loopholelabs.com/discord).
</Note>
