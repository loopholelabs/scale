description: Create, run, and publish your first Scale Function in minutes.
---

In this section we’ll be going over how you can quickly get started with Scale to create, run and even publish your own function.

We’ll be building a simple `Hello World` function using the [HTTP Signature](/signatures/http) that will return a simple greeting.

<Snippet file="install-scale-cli.mdx" />

For alternative installation methods or to build the CLI from source, please see the [CLI Installation Guide](/cli/installation).

## Install the Toolchain for your Guest Language

Scale Functions currently support using [Golang](https://go.dev), [TypeScript/JavaScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as the
Guest Languages, but compiling them requires the appropriate toolchain to be installed on your machine.

If you already have the toolchain for your Guest Language installed, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can follow
the guides for your Guest Language below to install the toolchain.

## Create a New Function

Once you have the Scale CLI and the toolchain for your Guest Language installed, you can create a new function by
running the following command, passing a `<name>:<tag>` pair to the `new` command:

```bash
scale fn new hello:1.0
```

This will create a new scale function in the current directory. You can also specify a different directory by passing the
`--directory` or `-d` flag:

```bash
scale fn new hello:1.0 -d /path/to/directory
```

<Note>
    By default, the CLI will create a new function using Golang as the Guest Language. If you want to use Rust instead,
    you can pass the `--language` or `-l` flag:

    ```bash
    scale fn new hello:1.0 -l rust
    ```
</Note>

The following files will be created in the directory depending on the language you chose:

        The `scalefile` is the main configuration file for the function. It contains all of the metadata and configuration required
        to build and run the function. The `scale.go` file contains the actual implementation of the function, and
        the `go.mod` file is primarily used to provide [Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)
        and Auto-Completion support in your IDE.

You'll notice that at the end of the Scale Function we call the `Next()` function. This is because Scale Functions can be
chained together to form a pipeline. The `Next()` function is used to pass the context to the next function in the chain
and can be conditionally called based on the logic in your function.

This allows for powerful composability that's completely language agnostic. For example, you can use a rust function to validate the request, a golang function to process the
request, and a third rust function to generate the response!

If you call the `Next()` field and there is no next function in the chain, the function is a no-op and the context is returned.

<Info>
    When adding new dependencies to your function, you'll need to add references to them in the `scalefile` to make sure
    your function can be built properly.
</Info>

By default, the generated function will be configured to use the `HTTP Signature`,
which provides an interface for handling HTTP requests and responses. To learn more about the `HTTP Signature` and the
interfaces it provides, you can check out the [HTTP Signature Reference](/signatures/http).

<Note>
    The concept of a `Signature` is central to how Scale Functions provide cross-language type safety and it's documented
    in more detail in the [Signatures](/signatures/overview) section of the documentation.
</Note>

## Build the Function

Once you've created a new function, you can build it by running the following command:

```bash
scale function build
```

This will build the function and save it to the `Cache Directory` (which defaults to `~/.config/scale/functions` on Linux and macOS).
You can also specify a different directory by passing the `--cache-directory` flag:

```bash
scale function build --cache-directory /path/to/directory
```

<Info>
    The `Cache Directory` is where the Scale CLI stores all of the built functions. This is where the CLI will look for
    functions when you run commands like `scale fn run` or `scale fn push`.
</Info>

To list all of the functions that are currently in the `Cache Directory`, you can run the following command:

```bash
scale function list
```

```
  NAME (1)            TAG      ORG           LANGUAGE   SIGNATURE     HASH                                                               VERSION
 ------------------- -------- ------------- ---------- ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------
  hello              1.0     local         rust       http@v0.3.4   8dad03b701cd124b55ff5caf7a36a9af5d19759fc73a9e8299bea4816f929777   v1alpha
```

## Run the Function

Once you've built the function, you can run it by running the following command:

```bash
scale fn run local/hello:1.0
```

This will start a local HTTP server on port `8080` and will run the function whenever you make a request to it. You can
also specify a different port by passing the `--listen` or `-l` flag:

```bash
scale fn run local/hello:1.0 -l :3000
```

<Note>
    The `scale fn run` command is designed for use with the [HTTP Signature](/signatures/http). It can be used for both
    local development and production deployments and makes it easy to test your function without having to deploy it.
</Note>

## Push the Function

Now that you've built and tested your function, you can push it to the Scale Registry. Once pushed, the function can be
pulled and used in your existing Typescript or Golang services, or even by other users for their own applications.

<Note>
    Using the Scale Registry is completely free during our beta period. To learn more about our future plans for the Scale Registry,
    please join the `#scale` channel on our [Discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).
</Note>

To use the Scale Registry, you'll first have to authenticate with the Scale API. This process is the same for both new
and existing users.

<Tip>
    If you are a new user you can still follow along with this guide. Your account will be created automatically when
    you first sign in.
</Tip>

To authenticate with the Scale API, you can run the following command:

```bash
scale auth login
```

This will open a browser window and prompt you to log in to your Scale account. Once you've logged in, you can
close the browser window and return to the terminal. You should now be able to push your function to the Scale Registry.

To check that you're authenticated, you can run the following command:

```bash
scale auth status
```

```
  MEMBER ORGS   OWNED ORGS      EMAIL                         ORG
 ------------- --------------- ----------------------------- -------------
  []            [shivanshvij]   shivanshvij@loopholelabs.io   shivanshvij
```

<Note>
    It's also possible to authenticate with the Scale API using an API Key. To learn more about API Keys, you can check
    out the [API Keys](/cli/reference/apikey) section of the documentation.
</Note>

Once you've authenticated with the Scale API, you can push your function to the Scale Registry by running the following command:

```bash
scale function push hello:1.0
```

This will push the function to the Scale Registry and make it available for use in your existing services.

<Note>
    The Scale Registry is currently in beta and may be subject to changes in the future. To learn more about the
    Scale Registry, you can check out the [Registry](/registry/overview) section of the documentation or join the `#scale`
    channel in [our Discord](https://loopholelabs.com/discord).
</Note>

## Pulling a Function

Once you've pushed a function to the Scale Registry, you can pull it and use it in your existing services. To pull a function,
you can run the following command:

```bash
scale function pull <your organization>/hello:1.0
```

<Note>
    When you [pushed the function](#push-the-function) to the Scale Registry, it was pushed to a specific organization.
    You can find the name of the organization by running the `scale auth status` command.

    If you pushed the function using the `--public` flag, you can pull it without being authenticated with the Scale API.
</Note>

This will pull the function from the Scale Registry and save it to the `Cache Directory` (which defaults to `~/.config/scale/functions` on Linux and macOS).
You can also specify a different directory by passing the `--cache-directory` flag:

```bash
scale function pull <your organization>/hello:1.0 --cache-directory /path/to/directory
```

<Note>
    The `scale pull` command only pulls the contents of the scale function from the registry if it's not already present.
    If the function is already present, it will not be overwritten unless the `--force` flag is passed.
</Note>

## Next Steps

Now that you've created and pushed your first function, you can check out the
[Importing Scale Functions](/languages/golang/overview#importing-scale-functions) guide for [Golang](/languages/golang/overview#importing-scale-functions) and
[Typescript/Javascript](/languages/javascript-typescript/overview#importing-scale-functions) to learn how to use your function inside your existing services (and
to chain them alongside native functions).

You can also check out our [Adapter Guides](/languages/golang/adapters/net-http) to learn how to integrate your functions
with popular frameworks such as [Next.js](/languages/javascript-typescript/adapters/nextjs).

To learn more about how the Scale Registry works, you can check out the [Registry](/registry/overview) section, or you
can check out the [Signatures](/signatures/overview) section to learn more about how Scale Signatures work.
