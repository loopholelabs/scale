description: The net/http Adapter makes it easy to use Scale Functions with golang net/http standard library.
---

To make using Scale Functions from [Golang](https://golang.org) webservers easier, we've created a
[net/http adapter](https://github.com/loopholelabs/scale-http-adapters) that allows you to use a compiled Scale Function
as a handler for your [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) server.

## Getting Started

First, you'll need a [Golang](https://golang.org) application that uses the [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)
standard library. If you don't have a Golang application, you can use the following example to get started:
```go main.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
    })

    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

Next, install the Scale Runtime and the Scale HTTP Adapters package:
```bash
go get github.com/loopholelabs/scale && go get github.com/loopholelabs/scale-http-adapters
```

Now you're ready to start using Scale Functions in your Golang application!

## Embedding a Scale Function

To get started, let's create a Scale Function that returns a simple 'Hello World' message. This is as simple as
running the following command:
```bash
scale fn new hello
```

<Note>
    We're implicitly using the [Go](https://golang.org/) Guest Language in this example, but you can use any of the supported
    Guest Languages. To use a different Guest Language, you can use the `--language` flag when creating a new Scale Function.
</Note>

This will create a new Scale Function in the current directory. You can see the code for the Scale Function in the
`scale.go` file that gets generated. The Scale Function is a simple HTTP handler that returns a `Hello World` message:
```go
//go:build tinygo || js || wasm
package scale

import (
	signature "github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature-http"
)

func Scale(ctx *signature.Context) (*signature.Context, error) {
	ctx.Response().SetBody("Hello, World!")
	return ctx
}
```

Now lets build the Scale Function and export it locally:
```bash
scale build
```

At this point, we can choose to either embed the Scale Function into our Golang application at build time or import it using
the Scale Registry at runtime. In this example we'll embed the Scale Function into our Golang application at build time, but
you can learn how to import the Scale Function from the Scale Registry using our [Importing Scale Functions](/languages/golang/overview#using-the-registry) guide.

Run the following command to export the Scale Function locally:
```bash
scale function export local/hello:latest .
```

This will create a `hello-latest.scale` file in the current directory. Now we have everything we need to import
the Scale Function into our Golang application.

<Tip>
    Check out the [Scale CLI](/cli/installation) documentation for more information on how to use the Scale CLI to build and export
    Scale Functions.
</Tip>

To import the Scale Function into our Next.js App, it's as simple as using the native `import` statement:
```go main.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
	"embed"
	"io"
    "net/http"
	scale "github.com/loopholelabs/scale/go"
	adapter "github.com/loopholelabs/scale-http-adapters/http"
    "github.com/loopholelabs/scalefile/scalefunc"
)

//go:embed hello-latest.scale
var embeddedFunction []byte

func main() {
	sf := new(ScaleFunc)
	_ = sf.Decode(embeddedFunction)

	r, _ := scale.New(context.Background(), []*scalefunc.ScaleFunc{sf})
    handler := adapter.New(nil, r)

    http.Handle("/", handler)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

Now we can run our Golang application and test out our Scale Function:
```bash
go run main.go
```
