Scale Functions currently support using [Golang](https://go.dev) as both the [Guest](#guest-support) and the [Host](#host-support) language.

This means that you can write your Functions in Golang ([Guest Support](#guest-support)) and you can run Functions written in any supported
language inside a Golang application ([Host Support](#host-support)).

## Guest Support

A Scale Function written in [Golang](https://go.dev) often looks something like this:

 ```go scale.go
//go:build tinygo || js || wasm
package scale

import (
    signature "github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature-http"
)

func Scale(ctx *signature.Context) (*signature.Context, error) {
    ctx.Response().SetBody("Hello, World!")
    return ctx.Next()
}
```

The above example is a simple HTTP Function that responds with "Hello, World!" to any request.

Compiling these Functions requires the appropriate toolchain to be installed on your machine.

<Note>
    To streamline compiling Scale Functions in the future, we're working on a cloud build service that will allow you to
    compile your functions without having to install the toolchain on your machine. If you're interested in accessing this
    service as soon as it's available, please join the `#scale` on our [discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).
</Note>

### Installing the Golang Toolchain

To use [Golang](https://go.dev) as the Guest Language, you'll need to install the following:
- The [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) toolchain
- The [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/) compiler

The best way to install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) is to follow the official instructions for your
operating system and platform at [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

You can verify that Go was installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
go version
```

<Info>
    The minimum supported version of Go for use with Scale Functions is `1.18`.
</Info>


The best way to install [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/) is to follow the official
instructions for your operating system and platform at
[https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install).

You can verify that TinyGo was installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
tinygo version
```

<Info>
    The minimum supported version of TinyGo for use with Scale Functions is `0.27.0`.
</Info>

## Host Support

To use a compiled Scale Function (written in any supported language) inside a Golang application, there are 3 steps:
1. Import the Scale Function(s) into the Golang application by embedding them or by using the Registry
2. Create a new Scale Runtime and pass in the Scale Function(s)
3. Call the `Run` method on the Scale Runtime with your request

### Importing Scale Functions

Scale Functions can be imported into a Golang application in two ways:
- [Embedding them Directly](#embedding-scale-functions)
- [Using the Registry](#using-the-registry)

#### Embedding Scale Functions

Scale Functions can be embedded into a Golang application by using the `//go:embed` directive, after it has been
exported using the `scale fn export` command (see [Exporting Scale Functions](/cli/exporting)).

```go
import (
	"embed"
	"github.com/loopholelabs/scalefile/scalefunc"
)

//go:embed <path to exported function>
var embeddedFunction []byte

func main() {
    // ...
    sf := new(ScaleFunc)
	_ = sf.Decode(embeddedFunction)
    // ...
}
```

#### Using the Registry

Scale Functions can also be imported into a Golang application by using the Registry.

This has the advantage of allowing you import the function at runtime, rather than at compile time - however it does require your function
to be available in the [Scale Registry](/registry/overview). Functions will also automatically cached locally based on their
tags and hashes, so subsequent calls to `Download` will be much faster.

```go
import "github.com/loopholelabs/scale/go/registry"

func main() {
	// ...
    sf, _ := registry.Download("<function name>", "<function tag>", registry.WithOrganization("<organization name>"), registry.WithAPIKey("<api key>"))
    // ...
}
```

<Note>
    If your function is an official Scale Function you can omit the `registry.WithOrganization` option, and if your function
    is marked as public you can safely omit the `registry.WithAPIKey` option.

    All officially published scale functions are public. If you're interested in publishing your own functions, please join
    the `#scale` channel on our [discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).
</Note>


### Creating a Scale Runtime

Once you've imported your Scale Function(s) into your Golang application, you can create a new instance of the Scale Runtime
and pass in the Scale Function(s).

```go
import (
	"context"
	runtime "github.com/loopholelabs/scale/go"
)

func main() {
    // ...
	ctx := context.Background()
    r := runtime.New(ctx, sf) // Or runtime.New(ctx, sf1, sf2, sf3, ...)
    // ...
}
```

### Running a Scale Function

Once you've created the Scale Runtime, you can call the `Instance` method on it to get a new runtime instance.
The `Context` method of the `Instance` can then be used to set the request body, and the `Run` method can be used to
run the Scale Function (or Functions).

```go
import (
    "context"
    "github.com/loopholelabs/scale/go"
)

func main() {
    // ...
    i, _ := r.Instance()
    i.Context().Request.Body = []byte("Hello, World!")

	ctx := context.Background()
    _ = i.Run(ctx)
    // ...
}
```

It's important to note that an `Instance` can be reused multiple times, but it's not thread-safe. If you need to run
multiple instances of a Scale Function concurrently, you'll need to create a new `Instance` for each one.

Instances are heavily optimized and will recycle themselves automatically when they're no longer in use. This means that
creating instances are very cheap and you can create as many as you need as often as you need.

<Info>
    The `Instance` method itself **is** thread-safe and can be called concurrently.

### Putting it all Together

Here's a complete example of a Golang application that imports a Scale Function, creates a new Scale Runtime, and runs
it.
