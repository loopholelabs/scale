To make using Scale Functions with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Edge Functions easier, we've created a
[Next.js Adapter](https://github.com/loopholelabs/scale-http-adapters) that allows you to import a Scale Function
directly into your Next.js App.

<Note>
    It is not currently possible to use the Scale Registry to import a Scale Functions into a Next.js App at runtime because of
    the way [Vercel](https://vercel.com) deploys Next.js Edge Functions. However, you can still use the Scale Registry to deploy your
    Scale Functions and use the Next.js Adapter to import them into your Next.js App at build time.
</Note>

While it is possible to use Scale Functions with Next.js without the adapter, we recommend using the adapter to
simplify your code and make it easier to test.

## Getting Started

First, you'll need a [Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) with [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/quickstart#create-an-edge-function)
enabled. If you don't have one, you can create one with the following command:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

Next, install the Scale Runtime and the Scale HTTP Adapters package:
```bash
npm install @loopholelabs/scale @loopholelabs/scale-http-adapters
```

You'll also need to modify your `next.config.js` file to use the Scale HTTP Adapter Webpack Loader:
```js
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
}

const adapter = require('@loopholelabs/scale-http-adapters/nextjs');
module.exports = adapter.WithScale(nextConfig)
```

Now you're ready to start using Scale Functions in your Next.js App!

## Embedding a Scale Function

To get started, let's create a Scale Function that returns a simple 'Hello World' message. This is as simple as
running the following command:
```bash
scale fn new hello:1.0
```

<Note>
    We're implicitly using the [Go](https://golang.org/) Guest Language in this example, but you can use any of the supported
    Guest Languages. To use a different Guest Language, you can use the `--language` flag when creating a new Scale Function.
</Note>

This will create a new Scale Function in the current directory. You can see the code for the Scale Function in the
`scale.go` file that gets generated. The Scale Function is a simple HTTP handler that returns a `Hello World` message:
```go
//go:build tinygo || js || wasm
package scale

import (
	signature "github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature-http"
)

func Scale(ctx *signature.Context) (*signature.Context, error) {
	ctx.Response().SetBody("Hello, World!")
	return ctx
}
```

Now lets build the Scale Function and export it locally:
```bash
scale build && scale function export hello:1.0.
```

This will create a `hello-latest.scale` file in the current directory. Because of the way [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
deploys Edge Functions, we also need to export a raw version of the Scale Function. To do this, we can use the
`--raw` flag with the previous export command:
```bash
scale function export hello:latest . --raw
```

This will create a `hello-latest.wasm` file in the current directory. Now we have everything we need to import
the Scale Function into our Next.js App.

<Tip>
    Check out the [Scale CLI](/cli/installation) documentation for more information on how to use the Scale CLI to build and export
    Scale Functions.
</Tip>

To import the Scale Function into our Next.js App, it's as simple as using the native `import` statement:
```js pages/api/hello.js
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import { NextJS } from '@loopholelabs/scale-http-adapters';
import { New, Func } from "@loopholelabs/scale";
// @ts-ignore
import example from "./hello-latest.scale"
// @ts-ignore
import exampleModule from "./hello-latest.wasm?module"

export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

const fn = new Func(example, exampleModule);
// @ts-ignore
const runtime = New([fn]);
const handler = (new NextJS(runtime)).Handler();

export default async (req: NextRequest) => {
    // @ts-ignore
  return await handler(req);
}
```

Remember to add the `export const config = { runtime: 'edge' };` line to your API route. This tells Vercel to deploy
the API route as an Edge Function, which is required for WebAssembly modules to work.

You'll also need to add the `// @ts-ignore` comments to the `import` statements to tell TypeScript to ignore the
`.scale` and `.wasm` file imports since webpack will handle them at build time.

<Note>
    The `?module` query parameter is required when importing a raw Scale Function (WebAssembly Module) into a Next.js App. This tells
    Vercel to treat the file as a WebAssembly module and compile it to WebAssembly before deploying it. Vercel explicitly
    disables compiling WebAssembly modules at runtime, which is why we need to import the raw `.wasm` module at build time.
</Note>

With this, our API route is ready! Now let's modify our home page to call the API route and display the response:
```js pages/index.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function Home() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)
  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setLoading(true)
    fetch('/api/hello')
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        setData(data)
        setLoading(false)
      })
  }, [])

  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now we can run our Next.js App and see the results:
```bash
npm run dev
```
