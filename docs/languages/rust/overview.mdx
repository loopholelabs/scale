description: An overview of Rust support in Scale Functions
---

Scale Functions currently support using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as a [Guest](#guest-support) language.

This means that you can write your Functions in Rust ([Guest Support](#guest-support)).

## Guest Support

A Scale Function written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) often looks something like this:

```rust scale.rs
use scale_signature_http::context::Context;

pub fn scale(ctx: &mut Context) -> Result<&mut Context, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    ctx.response().set_body("Hello, World!".to_string());
    Ok(ctx)
}
```

The above example is a simple HTTP Function that responds with "Hello, World!" to any request.

By default, the generated function will be configured to use the `HTTP Signature`,
which provides an interface for handling HTTP requests and responses. To learn more about the `HTTP Signature` and the
interfaces it provides, you can check out the [HTTP Signature Reference](/signatures/http). Learn more about Signatures in the [Signatures Overview](/signatures/overview).

Compiling these Functions requires the appropriate toolchain to be installed on your machine.
