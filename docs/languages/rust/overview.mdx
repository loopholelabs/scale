Scale Functions currently support using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as the [Guest](#guest-support) language.

This means that you can write your Functions in Rust ([Guest Support](#guest-support)).

<Info>
    We are working on adding Host language support in the near future. If you would like to be part of this process,
    please join the `#scale` channel on our [Discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).

## Guest Support

A Scale Function written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) often looks something like this:

```rust scale.rs
use scale_signature_http::context::Context;

pub fn scale(ctx: &mut Context) -> Result<&mut Context, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    ctx.response().set_body("Hello, World!".to_string());
    Ok(ctx)
}
```

The above example is a simple HTTP Function that responds with "Hello, World!" to any request.

Compiling these Functions requires the appropriate toolchain to be installed on your machine.

<Note>
    To streamline compiling Scale Functions in the future, we're working on a cloud build service that will allow you to
    compile your functions without having to install the toolchain on your machine. If you're interested in accessing this
    service as soon as it's available, please join the `#scale` on our [discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).
</Note>

### Installing the Rust Toolchain

To use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as the Guest Language, you'll need to install the following:
- The [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) toolchain
- The [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) package manager
- The [wasm32-unknown-unknown](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#platform-specific-dependencies) build target

The best way to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is to follow the official instructions for
your operating system and platform at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

In general, you'll want to install the `rustup` tool, which will allow you to easily install and manage multiple
versions of Rust on your machine. This can be done by running the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You can verify that Rust was installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
rustc --version
```

<Info>
    The minimum supported version of Rust for use with Scale Functions is `1.67.0`.
</Info>

You can verify that Cargo was installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
cargo --version
```

<Info>
    The minimum supported version of Cargo for use with Scale Functions is `1.67.0`.
</Info>

Next, you'll need to install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build target. This can be done by running the following
command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

You can verify that the build target was installed correctly by running the following command and verifying that
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` is listed in the output:

```bash
rustup target list --installed
```
