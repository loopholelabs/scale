description: An overview of Rust support in Scale Functions
---

Scale Functions currently support using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as the [Guest](#guest-support) language.

This means that you can write your Functions in Rust ([Guest Support](#guest-support)).

<Info>
    We are working on adding Host language support in the near future. If you would like to be part of this process,
    please join the `#scale` channel on our [Discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).

## Guest Support

A Scale Function written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) often looks something like this:

```rust scale.rs
use scale_signature_http::context::Context;

pub fn scale(ctx: &mut Context) -> Result<&mut Context, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    ctx.response().set_body("Hello, World!".to_string());
    Ok(ctx)
}
```

The above example is a simple HTTP Function that responds with "Hello, World!" to any request.

Compiling these Functions requires the appropriate toolchain to be installed on your machine.

<Note>
    To streamline compiling Scale Functions in the future, we're working on a cloud build service that will allow you to
    compile your functions without having to install the toolchain on your machine. If you're interested in accessing this
    service as soon as it's available, please join the `#scale` on our [discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).
