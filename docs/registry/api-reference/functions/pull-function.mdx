title: Pull a Function
openapi: "GET /registry/function/{organization}/{name}/{tag}"
---
Retrieves a function from the given `organization` given its `name` and `tag`. If the
session is scoped to the same `organization`, functions that are not
public will be returned, otherwise only public functions will be
returned.

The actual content of the function will not be returned via this response, and instead the `presigned_url` field
of the response will contain a URL that can be used to retrieve the function's content via a `GET` request.
