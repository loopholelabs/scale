description: Learn about the Scale Registry.
---

The Scale Registry designed to be used to store and distribute compiled Scale Functions. The Scale Registry is a RESTful API and has an OpenAPI Specification available at
[https://api.scale.sh/v1/swagger.json](https://api.scale.sh/v1/swagger.json).

<Note>
    Using the Scale Registry is completely free during our beta period. To learn more about our future plans for the Scale Registry,
    please join the `#scale` channel on our [Discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).
</Note>

Most interactions with the Scale Registry can be done using the [Scale CLI](/cli/reference/registry), which is the recommended
method of interacting with the API.

## Authentication

The Scale Registry can be authenticated using a [Cookie](#cookie-authentication) which is returned from the Authentication API, or by sending an
[API Key](#api-key-authentication) in the `Authorization` header.

<Warning>
    We do not recommend using the Cookie authentication method yourself - [the Scale CLI will handle this for you](/cli/reference/auth) when
    you authenticate with it. Instead, we recommend using the API Key authentication method.
</Warning>

### API Key Authentication
API Keys can be created by the [Scale CLI](/cli/reference/auth) and used by sending an `Authorization: Bearer <API Key>`
header with each request.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.scale.sh/v1/userinfo \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API Key>'
```

You can also use the built-in [API Client](/registry/api-reference/userinfo) to experiment with the Scale Registry API from your
browser.

### Cookie Authentication

The Scale Registry can be authenticated using a Cookie which is returned from the Authentication API. The Cookie must be sent
with each request, and the API will periodically refresh the Cookie in the returned response.

To get an Authentication Cookie, head to [https://scale.sh/login](https://scale.sh/login) and enter your log in information. Once you're
redirected to the success page, you can copy the `auth-session` Cookie from your browser's developer tools.
