**Scale** is a high-performance, language-agnostic function runtime powered by
<Tooltip tip="Compile and run code in any language from environment">WebAssembly</Tooltip> that enables developers to
easily compose and chain together functions in different languages, resulting in middleware-like functionality.

With support for guest languages such as **Golang and Rust**, and host languages like **Golang and Typescript**, Scale Functions offer a
flexible solution for composable software development.
