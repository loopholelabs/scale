### Installing the Rust Toolchain

To use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as the Guest Language, you'll need to install the following:
- The [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) toolchain
- The [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) package manager
- The [wasm32-unknown-unknown](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#platform-specific-dependencies) build target

The best way to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is to follow the official instructions for
your operating system and platform at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

In general, you'll want to install the `rustup` tool, which will allow you to easily install and manage multiple
versions of Rust on your machine. This can be done by running the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You can verify that Rust was installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
rustc --version
```

<Info>
    The minimum supported version of Rust for use with Scale Functions is `1.67.0`.

You can verify that Cargo was installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
cargo --version
```

<Info>
    The minimum supported version of Cargo for use with Scale Functions is `1.67.0`.

Next, you'll need to install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build target. This can be done by running the following
command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

You can verify that the build target was installed correctly by running the following command and verifying that
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` is listed in the output:

```bash
rustup target list --installed
```
