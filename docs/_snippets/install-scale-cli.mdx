## Install the Scale CLI

The Scale CLI is the primary tool for interacting with Scale Functions and the Scale Registry. It can be easily installed using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dl.scale.sh | sh
```

<Info>
    The CLI attempts to install itself to `/usr/local/bin` by default, but you can also specify a different directory by setting the `INSTALL` environment variable like so:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://dl.scale.sh | INSTALL=./ sh
    ```
</Info>

To verify that the CLI was installed correctly, check the scale cli version by running the following command:

```bash
scale version
```
