description: How to use the `signature` command in the Scale CLI.
---

The `signature` command is used to interact with Scale Signatures locally. `sig` is an alias for `signature`.

## New

To create a new Scale Signature, run the following command:

```bash
scale signature new
```

This will create a new scale signature in the current directory in the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language.

You can also specify the language of the signature you want to create by using the `--language` flag:

```bash
scale signature new --language <language>
```

The following languages are currently supported:

  * `go` - [Go](/languages/golang/overview)
  * `rust` - [Rust](/languages/rust/overview)
  * `ts` - [TypeScript/JavaScript](/languages/javascript-typescript/overview)

<Note>
    We are actively working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to see a specific language supported, please let
    us know by joining the `#scale` channel in [our Discord](https://loopholelabs.com/discord).
</Note>

## Generate

Generate a scale signature from a signature file

```bash
scale signature generate <name:tag>
```

This will generate the signature defined in the local directory, in your `local/` organization.


<Note>
    To learn about how to install the toolchain for a specific language, see the documentation for that language:

    * [Go](/languages/golang/overview)
    * [Rust](/languages/rust/overview)
</Note>

## Use

Create a new scale signature with the given name and tag.

```bash
scale signature use <org>/<name:tag>
```

## List

The `list` subcommand is used to list all the compiled Scale Signatures available in the local Scale Signatures cache.

```bash
scale signature list
```

If you'd like to specify the directory of the Scale Signature cache, you can use the `--cache-directory` flag:

```bash
scale signature list --cache-directory <cache-directory>
```

## Export

Export a generated scale signature to the given output path

```bash
scale signature export <org>/<name>:<tag> <language> <guest|host> <output_path>
```

## Delete

To delete a Scale Signature from the local Scale Signature cache, run the following command:

```bash
scale signature delete [<org>/<name>:<tag>]
```
