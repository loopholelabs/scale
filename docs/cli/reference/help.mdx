---

`help` is a command that displays a list of commands available in the Scale CLI and their descriptions.
On its own, it's effectively the same as running `scale` with no arguments.

It can be used to get a list of all commands available in the Scale CLI:

```bash
scale help
```

It can also be used to get a list of all commands available in a specific category:

```bash
scale help <category>
```

Or, it can be used to get a description of a specific command:

```bash
scale help <category> <command>
```
