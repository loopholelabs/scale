description: How to use the `auth` command in the Scale CLI.
---

The `auth` command is used to authenticate the CLI to the Scale API. This is a required step before using the Scale Registry. It is not required to work with Scale Functions locally.

## Login

To login to the Scale API, run the following command:

```bash
scale auth login
```

This command will attempt to open the browser and undergo a [Device Authorization Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/device-auth) with the Scale API.
If the browser cannot be opened, the CLI will print a URL and a code that can be used to login to the Scale API.

<Info>
    The `scale login` command is an alias for `scale auth login`. You can use either command to login to the Scale API.

### Using an API Key

To login to the Scale API using an API Key, run the following command:

```bash
scale auth login --api-key <API_KEY>
```

<Tip>
    You can also use the `SCALE_API_KEY` environment variable to login to the Scale API using an API Key.
</Tip>

## Logout

To logout of the Scale API, run the following command:

```bash
scale auth logout
```

This command will remove the authentication token from the CLI and disable the session.

## Status

To check the current authentication status, run the following command:

```bash
scale auth status
```

This command will print the current authentication status, including the user's email address and their organization name.
