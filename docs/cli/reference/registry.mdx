description: How to use the `registry` command in the Scale CLI.
---

The `registry` command is used to interact with the [Scale Registry](/registry/overview). `reg` is an alias for `registry`.

The 'registry' is used with both [functions](/getting-started/quick-start#create-a-new-function) and [signatures](/signatures/overview), and, as such, the aliases `fn` and `sig` can be used, respectively.

This reference page assumes you have already [installed the Scale CLI](/cli/installation),
and are [authenticated](/cli/auth) with your Scale account.

<Note>
    Using the Scale Registry is completely free during our beta period. To learn more about our future plans for the Scale Registry,
    please join the `#scale` channel on our [Discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).

# Functions

## Push a Function

To push a function to the registry, use the `push` command:

```bash
scale registry function push [<name>:<tag> | [<org>/<name>:<tag>]
```

The function must be built and available locally in the function cache to be pushed to the registry.

The `--override-name`, `--override-org`, and `--override-tag` flags can be used to override the name, organization, and tag of the function, respectively.

The `--public` flag can be used to make the function public, meaning it can be pulled by anyone.

## Pull a Function

To pull a function from the registry, use the `pull` command:

```bash
scale registry function pull [<org>/<name>:<tag>]
```

The function will be pulled from the registry and stored in the function cache. If the function is already in the cache,
it will not be overwritten unless the `--force` flag is used.

## List a Function

To list all functions in your user's organization in the Scale Registry, use the `list` command:

```bash
scale registry function list
```

The `--org` flag can be used to list functions in a specific organization, but it must be an organization you are a member of otherwise only
public functions in that organization will be listed.

## Delete a Function

To delete a function from the Scale Registry, use the `delete` command:

```bash
scale registry function delete [<org>/<name>:<tag>]
```
