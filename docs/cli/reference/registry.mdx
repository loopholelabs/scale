description: How to use the registry command in the Scale CLI.

The `registry` command is used to interact with the [Scale Registry](/registry/overview). `reg` is an alias for `registry`.

This reference page assumes you have already [installed the Scale CLI](/docs/cli/installation),
and are [authenticated](/docs/cli/auth) with your Scale account.

<Note>
    Using the Scale Registry is completely free during our beta period. To learn more about our future plans for the Scale Registry,
    please join the `#scale` channel on our [Discord](https://loopholelabs.io/discord).

## Push a Function

To push a function to the registry, use the `registry push` command:

```bash
scale registry push [<name>:<tag> | [<org>/<name>:<tag>]
```

The function must be built and available locally in the function cache to be pushed to the registry.

The `--override-name`, `--override-org`, and `--override-tag` flags can be used to override the name, organization, and tag of the function, respectively.

The `--public` flag can be used to make the function public, meaning it can be pulled by anyone.

<Info>
    The `scale push` command is an alias for `scale registry push`. You can use either command to push a function to the registry.

## Pull a Function

To pull a function from the registry, use the `registry pull` command:

```bash
scale registry pull [<org>/<name>:<tag>]
```

The function will be pulled from the registry and stored in the function cache. If the function is already in the cache,
it will not be overwritten unless the `--force` flag is used.

## List

To list all functions in your user's organization in the Scale Registry, use the `registry list` command:

```bash
scale registry list
```

The `--org` flag can be used to list functions in a specific organization, but it must be an organization you are a member of otherwise only
public functions in that organization will be listed.

## Delete

To delete a function from the Scale Registry, use the `registry delete` command:

```bash
scale registry delete [<org>/<name>:<tag>]
```
