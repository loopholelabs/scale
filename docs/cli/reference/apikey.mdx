description: How to use the apikey command in the Scale CLI.
---

The `apikey` command is used to manage API keys in the Scale CLI.
API keys are used to programmatically authenticate with the Scale API, and are associated with a user's account.

API Keys can be created, listed, and deleted, but **not edited**. API Keys also **do not expire**, and can be used indefinitely.

<Info>
    In the future we will be introducing a new authentication method called **Service Keys** which will allow you to
    create programmatic access keys (similar to API Keys) that can be scoped to specific resource, can be set to expire automatically,
    or used a maximum number of times.

    If you are interested in this feature, please join the `#scale` channel in [our Discord](https://loopholelabs.io/scale) and let us know!
</Info>

This reference page assumes you have already [installed the Scale CLI](/cli/installation),
and are [authenticated](/cli/auth) with your Scale account.

## Creating an API Key

To create an API Key, run the following command:

```bash
scale apikey create <name>
```

This will create a new API Key with the given name, and print the key to the console. The API Key will only be shown once,
so make sure to copy it to a safe place.

<Note>
    The format of the returned API Key is `<ID>.<Secret>`. This means that the `ID` of an API Key is the string that appears
    before the period (`.`), and the `Secret` of an API Key is the string that appears after the period (`.`).
</Note>

## Listing API Keys

API Keys can be listed using the following command:

```bash
scale apikey list
```

<Tip>
    Remember that you can change the output format using [the `--format` flag](/cli/flags).
</Tip>

## Deleting an API Key

To delete an API Key, run the following command:

```bash
scale apikey delete <name>
```

If you do not know the name of the API Key you want to delete, you can use its ID instead:

```bash
scale apikey delete <id>
```

<Note>
    The format of the returned API Key is `<ID>.<Secret>`. This means that the `ID` of an API Key is the string that appears
    before the period (`.`), and the `Secret` of an API Key is the string that appears after the period (`.`).
</Note>

## Get API Key Information

To get information about an API Key, run the following command:

```bash
scale apikey get <name>
```

If you do not know the name of the API Key you want to get information about, you can use its ID instead:

```bash
scale apikey get <id>
```

<Tip>
    Remember that you can change the output format using [the `--format` flag](/cli/flags).
</Tip>

## Authenticating with an API Key

To authenticate with an API Key, you can either specify the `--api-key` flag when [authentication with the Scale CLI](/cli/auth),
or you can set the `SCALE_API_KEY` environment variable to the API Key you want to use when running the same command.

Once you've authenticated with an API Key, you can use the Scale CLI to interact with your Scale account.
