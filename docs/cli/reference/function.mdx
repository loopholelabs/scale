The `function` command is used to interact with Scale Functions locally. `fn` is an alias for `function`.

## New

To create a new Scale Function, run the following command:

```bash
scale function new <name>
```

This will create a new scale function in the current directory in the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language.

<Info>
    The `scale new` command is an alias for `scale function new`. You can use either command to login to the Scale API.
</Info>

You can also specify the language of the function you want to create by using the `--language` flag:

```bash
scale function new <name> --language <language>
```

The following languages are currently supported:

  * `go` - [Go](/languages/golang/overview)
  * `rust` - [Rust](/languages/rust/overview)
  * `ts` - [TypeScript/JavaScript](/languages/javascript-typescript/overview)

<Note>
    We are actively working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to see a specific language supported, please let
    us know by joining the `#scale` channel in [our Discord](https://loopholelabs.com/discord).
</Note>

## Build

The `build` subcommand is used to build a Scale Function using the toolchain for the Scale Function's source language. It can be
run from the root of the Scale Function's directory:

```bash
scale function build
```

The `--directory` flag can be used to specify the directory of the Scale Function:

```bash
scale function build --directory <directory>
```

The compiled Scale Function will be placed in the local Scale Function cache. If you'd like to specify the directory of the Scale Function cache, you can use the `--cache-directory` flag:

```bash
scale function build --cache-directory <cache-directory>
```

The `--name`, `--org`, and `--tag` flags can be used to specify the name, organization, and tag of the Scale Function at build time:

```bash
scale function build --name <name> --org <org> --tag <tag>
```

Because this command relies on the toolchain for the Scale Function's source language being installed on your machine, it may sometimes
be necessary to tell the command where it can find the toolchain executables.

The `--cargo`, `--go`, and `--tinygo` flags can be used to specify the path to the `cargo`, `go`, and `tinygo` executables.

<Note>
    To learn about how to install the toolchain for a specific language, see the documentation for that language:

    * [Go](/languages/golang/overview)
    * [Rust](/languages/rust/overview)
</Note>

## List

The `list` subcommand is used to list all the compiled Scale Functions available in the local Scale Function cache.

```bash
scale function list
```

If you'd like to specify the directory of the Scale Function cache, you can use the `--cache-directory` flag:

```bash
scale function list --cache-directory <cache-directory>
```

## Run

You can run your compiled scale functions locally using the `run` subcommand. This command will start a local HTTP server that will
execute the Scale Function when it receives an HTTP request.

```bash
scale function run  [ ...[ <name>:<tag> ] | [ <org>/<name>:<tag> ] ]
```

The `--listen` flag can be used to specify the address and port that the local HTTP server should listen on (by default it will listen on `:8080`)

It is also possible to provide multiple Scale Functions to the `run` subcommand. If you do, the local HTTP server will execute the
Scale Functions in a chain, and will only execute the next function in the chain if the previous function calls `.Next()`.

<Tip>
    Remember that the `--cache-directory` [configuration flag](/cli/reference/flags) can be used to specify the directory of the Scale Function cache.
</Tip>

If the function is not available locally, the `run` command will attempt to look for it in the [Scale Registry](/registry/overview) (if the CLI is authenticated).

## Export

The `export` subcommand is used to export a Scale Function from the local Scale Function cache to a local `.scale` file.

It's helpful in situations where you want to distribute a Scale Function without using the [Scale Registry](/registry/overview), or
if you want to embed it inside your Runtime or Application.

```bash
scale function export [<name>:<tag> | [<org>/<name>:<tag>] <path>
```

The function will be exported to the specified `<path>` directory as a `.scale` file. The `--output` flag can be used to override
the name of the exported `.scale` file:

```bash
scale function export [<name>:<tag> | [<org>/<name>:<tag>] <path> --output <output>
```

The `--raw` flag can be used to export the raw [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) `.wasm` binary instead of the `.scale` file:

```bash
scale function export [<name>:<tag> | [<org>/<name>:<tag>] <path> --raw
```

## Delete

To delete a Scale Function from the local Scale Function cache, run the following command:

```bash
scale function delete [<name>:<tag> | [<org>/<name>:<tag>]
```
