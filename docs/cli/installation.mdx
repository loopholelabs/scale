The Scale CLI is a command line interface for interacting with the Scale API and for working with Scale Functions locally.
It facilitates interfacing with the [Scale Registry](/registry/overview) as well as building, running, and interacting with Scale Functions locally.

The CLI is written in [Golang](https://golang.org/) and is [Open Source](https://github.com/loopholelabs/scale-cli).

## Building from Source

To build the CLI from source, you will need to have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed. Then, you can clone the
source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loopholelabs/scale-cli
cd scale-cli
```

<Note>
    The minimum supported version of [Go](https://golang.org/) for building the Scale CLI is **1.20**.
</Note>

Building the CLI can be done with the following command:

```bash
cd cmd
go build -o scale .
```

This will create a binary called `scale` in the `cmd` directory. You can then move this binary to a directory in your
`PATH` to use it.

## Using the Scale CLI

Once you have the Scale CLI installed, you can use it to interact with the Scale API and to build, run, and interact with
Scale Functions locally.

Check out the [Scale CLI Reference](/cli/reference) for more information on how to use the CLI.
