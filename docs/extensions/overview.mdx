description: Learn how Scale Extensions work and how they're used in Scale Functions.

Extensions are function-scoped, strongly-typed interfaces, coupled with performant translation-layer code, allowing for safe, structured access to underlying host resources.

Wasm modules are secure sandboxes, with no access or knowledge of anything outside said box by default -- but what if you want to turn a Scale Function into, say, a webhook? With an extension, you're able to create a strongly-typed, usable HTTP call interface for just your function.

We use the [Polyglot](https://github.com/loopholelabs/polyglot-go) library under the hood to facilitate efficient
serialization and deserialization of structured data between host and guest languages and to cross the Wasm boundary.

For information on use, see the CLI Reference [CLI API reference](/cli/reference/extensions)
