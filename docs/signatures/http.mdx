description: The HTTP Signature for Scale Functions
---

The [HTTP Signature](https://github.com/loopholelabs/scale-signature-http) for Scale Functions is meant to be used
to implement HTTP handlers and middleware in supported guest languages.

It's designed to allow developers to read and modify the incoming request as well as the outgoing response.

## Usage

The HTTP Signature is implemented differently between the Guest and Host languages. The Host language has direct access
to the HTTP [Request](#request) and [Response](#response) objects, while the Guest language has accessor methods to
read and modify the request and response.

This allows the Host language complete control over the HTTP request and response, while the Guest language has stricter
restrictions on what can be modified and how it can be modified.

### Request

The HTTP Request object contains the following fields:

| Field                             | Type         | Description                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| [uri](#uri)                       | `string`     | The URI of the request.           |
| [method](#method)                 | `enum`       | The HTTP method of the request.   |
| [content_length](#content-length) | `uint64`     | The length of the request body.   |
| [protocol](#protocol)             | `enum`       | The HTTP protocol of the request. |
| [ip](#ip)                         | `string`     | The IP address of the request.    |
| [body](#body)                     | `bytes`      | The request body.                 |
| [headers](#headers)               | `string_map` | The request headers.              |

It can be accessed using the `Request(): Request` method. The following are methods that can be used on the returned object.

#### URI

The `uri` field is a `string` that contains the URI of the request. It can be accessed using the `URI(): string` method and
modified using the `SetURI(uri: string)` method.

#### Method

The `method` field is an `enum` that contains the HTTP method of the request. It can be accessed using the `Method(): method`
method and modified using the `SetMethod(method: method)` method.

Valid values for the `method` field are:
- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `HEAD`
- `OPTIONS`

#### Content Length

The `content_length` field is a `uint64` that contains the length of the request body. It can be accessed using the
`ContentLength(): uint64` method and modified using the `SetContentLength(length: uint64)` method.

#### Protocol

The `protocol` field is an `enum` that contains the HTTP protocol of the request. It can be accessed using the
`Protocol(): protocol` method and modified using the `SetProtocol(protocol: protocol)` method.

Valid values for the `protocol` field are:
- `HTTP/1.1`
- `HTTP/2`
- `HTTP/3`

#### IP

The `ip` field is a `string` that contains the IP address of the request. It can be accessed using the `IP(): string` method
and modified using the `SetIP(ip: string)` method.

#### Body

The `body` field is a `bytes` that contains the request body. It can be accessed using the `Body(): []bytes` method and modified
using the `SetBody(body: []bytes)` method.

If you'd like to set the body to a string, you can use the `SetBodyString(body: string)` method.

#### Headers

The `headers` field is a `string_map` that contains the request headers. It can be accessed using the `Header()` method.

Writing a key to the headers returned by the `Header(): header` method can be done using the `Set(key: string, value: []string)` method. Reading a key from
the headers returned by the `Header(): header` method can be done using the `Get(key: string): []string` method.

### Response

The HTTP Response object contains the following fields:

| Field                             | Type         | Description                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| [status_code](#status-code)       | `uint32`     | The status code of the response.   |
| [body](#body-2)                   | `bytes`      | The response body.                 |
| [headers](#headers-2)             | `string_map` | The response headers.              |

It can be accessed using the `Response(): Response` method. The following are methods that can be used on the returned object.

#### Status Code

The `status_code` field is a `uint32` that contains the status code of the response. It can be accessed using the
`StatusCode(): uint32` method and modified using the `SetStatusCode(status_code: uint32)` method.


#### Body

The `body` field is a `bytes` that contains the response body. It can be accessed using the `Body(): []bytes` method and modified
using the `SetBody(body: []bytes)` method.

If you'd like to set the body to a string, you can use the `SetBodyString(body: string)` method.

#### Headers

The `headers` field is a `string_map` that contains the response headers. It can be accessed using the `Header()` method.

Writing a key to the headers returned by the `Header(): header` method can be done using the `Set(key: string, value: []string)` method. Reading a key from
the headers returned by the `Header(): header` method can be done using the `Get(key: string): []string` method.

## Definition

The HTTP Signature is defined as follows using the **Scale Signature** syntax:

```hcl http.signature
version = "v1alpha"
context = "request"

model Headers {
    string "values" {
        default = ""
        accessor = true
    }
}

model Request {
    string "uri" {
        default = ""
        accessor = true
    }

    string "method" {
      default     = "GET"
    }


    uint64 ContentLength {
        default = 0
        accessor = true
    }

    string "protocol" {
        default = "HTTP/1.1"
    }

    string "ip" {
        default = ""
        accessor = true
    }

    bytes "body" {
        accessor = true
        initial_size = 0
    }

    string_map HttpHeaders {
      value = "headers"
    }
}

model Response {
    uint32 StatusCode {
        default = 200
        accessor = true
        limit_validator {
            min = 100
            max = 599
        }
    }

    bytes "body" {
        initial_size = 0
        accessor = true
    }

    string_map HttpHeaders {
      value = "headers"
    }
}
```
