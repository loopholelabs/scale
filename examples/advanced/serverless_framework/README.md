# Serverless Framework

This repo provides the basic building blocks for creating your own serverless function runtime with Scale.

## Why Scale?

Importance for User-defined logic
- Performance: faster startup times compared with containers
- Scale (no pun intended): smaller binaries, use across architectures
- Safety: Sandboxed user-defined code

## Local install

1) go mod tidy, go run

2) npm dev run

3) [Build your scale function](https://scale.sh/docs/getting-started/quick-start#build-the-function)
