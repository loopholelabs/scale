### Changes 

- Added `runtime.NewSignature` type to signify a factory function for creating a new `signature.Signature` type.

- Updated `runtime_test.go` to use the new `runtime.New` function signature.
- Updated the `runtime.Instance` function to make the `next` argument optional. 
- `instance.RuntimeContext` is now a private function since we don't expect developers to use it directly.
